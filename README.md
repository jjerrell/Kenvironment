# Kenvironment

Kenvironment aims to be a cohesive utility which allows for environment specific settings, such as DB URLs, Tokens, Host
URLs, and hopefully anything else you come up with.

While this cannot replace the functionality provided by Build Flavors, it is an attempt to find a balance between a 
flavor and a configuration service in an Android or Kotlin Multiplatform project.

## Contribution

Kenvironment is envisioned to be a ridiculously lightweight and highly customizable engine which allows augmentation
through a plugin-based system.
