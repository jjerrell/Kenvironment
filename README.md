# Kenvironment

Kenvironment aims to be a cohesive utility which allows for environment specific settings, such as DB URLs, Tokens, Host URLs, API endpoints, and hopefully anything else you come up with.

While this cannot replace the functionality provided by Build Flavors in Kotlin Multiplatform, it is an attempt to find a balance between a flavor and a configuration service in a Kotlin Multiplatform project.
